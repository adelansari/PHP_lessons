Task 3: A real-world example

If we just want to loop through numbers, a for loop is a natural choice instead of a while loop. A much more common real-world example in PHP would be looping through input from a file or a database. Download the PHP file and data file below to your PHP folder and see if you can complete the program. (Don’t worry, it’s just one line you need to write.)
