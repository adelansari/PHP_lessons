# Task 1: Write a poem

## Description

Code a PHP page that reads the file poem.txt, displays its contents on the page and allows the user to add a new verse (line) to the poem with a form. You can use the template file below, if you wish.

Make sure to check the file exists before reading. Otherwise the page will throw an error (whether or not itâ€™s displayed depends on the server settings) before adding the first line, since there is no file yet.
